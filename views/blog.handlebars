            <p class="article-content">Today was an amazing day. My parents decided to take me out for a ride and I was so excited! Then we entered into a place and they left me there with strangers. I thought they left me forever but I was just getting a haircut. When we got back I was greeted by a brand new red bed and an awesome new toy! Their unconditional love for me I canâ€™t put into words but I can put it into kisses. </p>

            <p class="article-content">It's Christmas today. This wasn't the first Christmas morning that I got to share with my family, but so far it was my favorite. Everyone was home for Christmas this year, so we all got to spend time with each other. I got so many toys and treats for Christmas! The present I'm standing on in the picture wasn't actually for me. It's way too big to be for me! We exchanged our gifts, had breakfast, then all sat together and watched a Christmas movie. Everyone took turns giving me well deserved scratches. Best Christmas Ever!!</p>

            <p class="article-content">Today was my birthday and I got to eat two of my favorite treats: peanut butter and carrot cake! The cake was amazing I all but inhaled the entire thing. My sister made me the cake and everyone gathered around and sang me a happy birthday. It was amazing! They did make me wear this dumb hat, though. Luckily, I managed to shake the hat off and they didn't make me wear it again. The cake wasn't all I got, they gave me a bunch of new toys! A big carrot, a bunch of squirrels, and a dinosaur. I was playing with them for so long. This was the best birthday ever!!</p>
